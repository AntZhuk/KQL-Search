# KQL Search

This website was made to simplify the process of searching for KQL Queries that are publicly shared on GitHub.

Currently supported GitHub Repositories:

1. Matt Zorich: [Sentinel Queries](https://github.com/reprise99/Sentinel-Queries)
2. Rod Trent: [SentinelKQL](https://github.com/rod-trent/SentinelKQL)
3. Ugur Koc: [KQL_Intune](https://github.com/ugurkocde/KQL_Intune) 

more will be added soon ... 

I wrote a Blog about my motivation and the things I learned. You can find it here: 

# What is KQL? 

KQL, or Kusto Query Language, is a query language used to search and analyze data in Microsoft Azure's data platform. It is used to perform ad hoc queries on data stored in Azure data services, including Azure Log Analytics, Azure Data Explorer, and Azure Monitor logs.

KQL has a syntax similar to SQL, but is designed specifically for querying and analyzing log data. It allows users to filter and aggregate data, extract specific fields, and perform a wide range of statistical and analytical operations on data sets. KQL also has a number of built-in functions and operators that can be used to manipulate and analyze data.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
